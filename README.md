# README #

This is a very rough 1802 Emulator. It was built as a tool when I was playing around trying to get my old 1802 FIG-Forth up and running.

It will build under recent Xcode versions such as Xcode 6 or Xcode 7.

Listing files can be loaded and executed. There is application-specific code to treat some of the IO ports as serial input/output to a simple terminal facility.

This is in no way a polished final product, but it is made available on the off chance that *someone* else might find the code useful or interesting.
