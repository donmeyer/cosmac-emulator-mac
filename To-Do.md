#  To-Do


 * Add Q output LED
 * Breakpoints
 * UI cleanup
* Touchbar
* Recent files support
* CDP1861 Video emulation
* Virtual LEDs on an output port
* Figure out timing.
	- Show elapsed time as well as cycles
	- Allow setting clock speed?
	- Add a resetable cycle and time display (in addition to the total display)
* Make the CPU emulation run on a background thread, with the foreground thread doing the UI.
* Add configuration pulldown (or something) to set up memory map. Pick EPROM types, RAM sizes and locations, etc.
